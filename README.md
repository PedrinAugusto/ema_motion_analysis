# Automatic Rowing Biomechanics Analysis

Project using Openpose as a markerless pose estimation tool along with addition processing, in order to acquire biomechanical parameters such as stroke cadence and body angulations.

The Openpose Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is ilustrated in the image below.

The result of the processing is
